countries consistently, the World Bank’s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what “poverty” means in the world’s poorest countries. The original “$1a-day” line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day.

mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100 000 live births during the same time period. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100 000 live births, for a specified time period.","methodOfComputation":"The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.","summary":null,"data":[{"id":"3.1.1","disaggregations":[],"data":{"2007":{"year":2007,"value":276,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2008":{"year":2008,"value":271,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2009":{"year":2009,"value":283,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2010":{"year":2010,"value":248,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2011":{"year":2011,"value":184,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2012":{"year":2012,"value":155,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2013":{"year":2013,"value":143,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2014":{"year":2014,"value":157,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2015":{"year":2015,"value":141,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"},"2016":{"year":2016,"value":121,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Per 100 000 live births"}}}]},{"id":"3.1.2","description":"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel","iifId":"3.1.2","type":"SDG","isReported":true,"frequency":"Yearly","sources":["Department of health\nSouth African Demographic and health Survey (1998)\nStatistics South Africa\nSouth African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) (2016)"],"definition":"Percentage of live births attended by skilled health personnel during a specified time period.","methodOfComputation":"Number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctor, nurse or midwife) trained in providing quality obstetric care, including giving the necessary support and care to the mother and the newborn during childbirth and immediate postpartum period  Denominator: The total number of live births in the same period.

For each of the 15 capacities, one to five indicators are used to measure implementation status. For each indicator, the reporting State Party is asked to select which of the five levels best describes the State Party's current status. To move to the next level, all capacities described in previous levels should be in place for each indicator. The score of each indicator level is classified as a percentage of performance along the \"1 to 5\" scale. e.g. for a country selecting level 3 for indicator 2.1, the indicator level is expressed as: 3/5*100=60%","summary":null,"data":[{"id":"3.d.1","disaggregations":[{"type":"IHR preparedness","value":"National legislation"}],"data":{"2010":{"year":2010,"value":75,"disaggregations":[{"type":"IHR

Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 – 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country.
