Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 – 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country.

countries consistently, the World Bank’s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what “poverty” means in the world’s poorest countries.

While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day.

Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 – 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country.
