övergripande aggregerad indikator framtagen av Eus statistikbyrå Eurostat för att mäta och följa upp vad man definierar som risk för fattigdom eller social utestängning. Indikatorn består av tre delindikatorer vilka mäts i en den EU-reglerade statistiska undersökningen EU-SILC och som beskrivs nedan.\nDen första, risk för fattigdom, beskriver vilka inkomster människor har i relation till andra. Enligt den här definitionen anses en individ vars inkomst understiger 60% av medianinkomsten i ett land leva i risk för fattigdom, dvs definitionen överensstämmer med SCB:s inkomstfördelningsmått låg ekonomisk standard (se 1.2.1).\nDen andra indikatorn, allvarlig materiell fattigdom, försöker fånga brister i materiell standard. Det innebär att man uppgett att man inte har råd med utgifterna för minst fyra av nio poster. Det handlar exempelvis om att inte kunna betala för oförutsedda utgifter, inte ha råd med tillräcklig uppvärmning av bostaden eller att inte kunna betala skulder inom utsatt tid.\nDen tredje indikatorn, låg arbetsintensitet, tar fasta på vilka som hör till hushåll där de som är i arbetsför ålder arbetat mindre än 20 procent av möjlig arbetstid.\nEn individ som uppfyller minst ett av dessa kriterier anses riskera fattigdom eller social utestängning. Den största gruppen utgörs av de som har en inkomst lägre än 60% av medianinkomsten. Många personer ingår i två eller alla tre grupper, vilket medför att den totala andelen av befolkningen som riskerar fattigdom och social utestängning inte är lika med summan av de tre delarna. En person som ingår i flera av grupperna räknas bara en gång.","methodOfComputation":"En individ som ingår i hushåll som uppfyller minst ett av kriterier a) låg inkomst, b) allvarlig materiell fattigdom eller c) låg arbetsintensitet anses enligt Eurostat riskera fattigdom eller social utestängning.

Det handlar också om att inte kunna delta i sociala aktiviteter som kostar pengar, såsom att dela en måltid med släkt och vänner minst en gång i månaden eller kunna lägga pengar på nöjesaktiviteter. Indikatorn materiell och social fattigdom är en utveckling av de EU-indikatorer på materiell fattigdom som funnits sedan tidigare.

som bygger på Monte Carlo-simuleringar (Soldaat et al. 2017). Samtidigt beräknas en icke-linjär trend med 95% konfidensintervall baserat på de årliga gemensamma indexen. En kurva beräknas vardera utifrån punktruttsdata respektive standardruttsdata.\n\nIndikatorn bygger på trendberäkningar för var och en av de ingående arterna. Eftersom vi inte kan räkna alla dagfjärilar måste vi förlita oss på stickprov, vars värden vi förväntar oss ska vara proportionella mot det sanna antalet dagfjärilar. Resultaten från stickproven bearbetas sedan statistiskt och presenteras i form av index. Det är viktigt att tänka på att index inte ger sanningen, de speglar bara sanningen mer eller mindre bra. Hur väl de speglar sanningen beror på hur väl materialet motsvarar de antaganden som indexberäkningarna bygger på. Bland annat är stickprovets storlek viktigt: ju fler rutter och ju fler dagfjärilar, desto bättre index. Vi använder en indexeringsmetod som kallas TRIM (TRends & Indices for Monitoring data).\n\nRent statistiskt är TRIM en typ av loglinjär analys som bygger på ”maximum-likelihood-metoden” med antagandet att fjärilsantalen är Poisson-fördelade. Modellen kan ta hänsyn till de problem som ofta finns i inventeringsdata, nämligen att fjärilarna kan variera kraftigt i antal, att alla rutter inte räknas varje år, samt att ett års data inte är helt oberoende av föregående år. När ett nytt år läggs till förändras tidigare års TRIM-index, normalt dock i mycket marginell omfattning. Trim- trenderna beräknas med hjälp av en modul, ’rtrim’, som körs i programspråket R.","summary":"2010=1 and 1998=100","data":[{"id":"2.4.5(N)","disaggregations":[{"type":"Type of

Skatteverket. Då uppgifterna bereds, dataregistreras och bearbetas inom folkbokföringen genomförs både manuella och maskinella kontroller som kan ge upphov till rättelser och korrigeringar.\n\nNär uppgifterna sedan aviserats till SCB granskas de i de olika skeden av bearbetningar som görs innan de godkänns för inläggning i RTB:s observationsregister.\n\nVid datainsamlingen från administrativa källor utanför SCB, som exempelvis Arbetsförmedlingen, används en mall för databeställningar där population, referenstid och variabler specificeras. När datamaterialet kommer till SCB kontrolleras att levererat material motsvarar det som angetts i beställningen.\n\nSCB:s enkätenhet samlar in det frågeformulär som årligen går ut till nyinvandrade utrikesfödda och som utgör en indatakälla till Utbildningsregistret. De inkomna frågeformulären granskas i flera olika skeden av bearbetningen. Inflödet följs upp och jämförelser görs med tidigare år med avseende på svarsfrekvenser och ett flertal processvariabler.\n\nUniversitets- och högskoleregistret som är en källa till Utbildningsregistret, har sin insamling via LADOK. Granskning vid insamlingen sker inom Universitets- och högskoleregistret.\n\nSCB samlar på uppdrag av Skolverket in uppgifter om förskola, fritidshem, skola, vuxenutbildning och annan pedagogisk verksamhet. En del av Skolverksregistren är också viktiga indatakällor för UREG. Granskningen görs i framställningen av varje skolregister.\n\nBearbetningarna för statistiken är helt PC-baserade. Bearbetnings- programmen är skrivna i SAS och de manuella momenten är få. Resultaten kontrolleras noggrant för att upptäcka misstag samt jämförs med vissa livslängdstabeller för kvinnor och män som publicerats tidigare i befolkningsstatistiken. Det finns inga kända fel kvar i bearbetningsfasen. Kontroller för eventuella bearbetningsfel i grundmaterialet har inte gjorts och eventuella bearbetningsfel i respektive register/undersökning förekommer då även i livslängdstabeller efter utbildningsnivå.\n\nStatistiken bearbetas med kodning av ömsesidigt uteslutande kategorier utifrån ursprungliga värdemängder. Det görs för utbildningsnivå, födelseland och hushållstyp.\n\nUtbildningsnivå, högsta enligt SUN (svensk utbildningsnomenklatur)\n  - Uppgift saknas. Individer som har bortfallskod i UREG (betyder\natt utbildning saknas helt eller är okänd).\n  - Förgymnasial utbildningsnivå. Individer som klassificerats med\nförgymnasial utbildning kortare än 9 år eller med förgymnasial\nutbildning 9 år (motsvarande).\n  - Gymnasial utbildningsnivå. Individer som har gymnasial\nutbildning högst 2-årig eller gymnasial utbildning 3 år.\n Eftergymnasial utbildningsnivå. Individer som har eftergymnasial\nutbildning kortare än 3 år, eftergymnasial utbildning 3 år eller\nlängre eller forskarutbildning.\n\nHushållstyp\n  - Ensamstående. Individer som är ensamstående utan barn, ensamstående med barn under 25 år eller ensamstående med barn över 24 år.\n  - Sammanboende. Individer som är sammanboende utan barn, sammanboende med barn under 25 år eller sammanboende med barn över 24 år.\n  - Övriga hushåll. Individer i övriga hushåll utan barn, övriga hushåll med barn under 25 år eller övriga hushåll med barn över 24 år.\nBearbetningen av respektive register och urvalsundersökning beskrivs i

Syftet med detta är att kunna redovisa resultat för hela populationen och inte bara för de svarande. Vikterna har beräknats utifrån urvalsdesignen samt antaganden om objektsbortfall och täckningsfel. Beräkningen gjordes med hjälp av ett av SCB egenutvecklat SAS-makro (ETOS). Vikterna bygger på antagandet att ramen återspeglar populationen väl och därmed att över- och undertäckningen är försumbar. Dessutom antas att bortfallet inte skiljer sig från de svarande med avseende på undersöknings-variablerna.\n\nDesignvikten är den del av vikten som beror på urvalsdesignen. Vid bortfall kan det vara så att vissa grupper av urvalet svarar i större utsträckning än övriga, t.ex. kan äldre svara i högre grad än yngre. Om de grupper som svarat i högre grad har en annan fördelning med avseende på undersökningsvariablerna än övriga, kan detta ha en snedvridande effekt på resultatet. För att kompensera för detta har kalibreringsvikter använts. Vikterna bygger på antagandet att ramen återspeglar populationen väl och därmed att över- och undertäckningen är försumbar.\n\nVikterna multipliceras med objektens variabelvärden för att skapa statistikvärden gällande för populationen. Om vikterna inte används så kan resultaten bli helt missvisande. Vikterna kompenserar för objektsbortfallet men inte för det partiella bortfallet.","summary":"Percentage of women and men","data":[{"id":"5.2.3(N)","disaggregations":[{"type":"Age

The information collected seeks to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator also serves for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).\nThe conceptual framework for indicator 10.7.2 is IOM ́s Migration Governance Framework (MiGOF), which was welcomed by 157 countries (IOM Council Resolution C/106/RES/1310). The MiGOF has three principles and three objectives (figure 1).\nThe three objectives are specific and do not require any further conventions, laws or practices than the ones that are already existing. Taken together, these objectives ensure that migration is governed in an integrated and holistic way, responding to the need to consider mobile categories of people and address their needs for assistance in the event of an emergency, building resilience of individuals and communities, as well as ensuring opportunities for the economic and social health of the State.\n","summary":"UN score

Innebörden av varje subindikator beskrivs av FN som: \n15.2.1.1 Skogsmarkens årliga nettoförändringstakt\nAtt mäta förändringar i skogsmarkens omfattning är en viktig del i värderingen av hållbar skogsförvaltning. Subindikator 1 fokuserar både på förändringsriktningen, det vill säga om skogsmarken ökar eller minskar, och förändringstakten över tid. Det senare avser framförallt att fånga förändringar i länder där skogsmarken minskar, men där förändringarna sker i långsammare takt än tidigare.\n15.2.1.2 Skogens biomassalager ovan jord\nFörändringar i skogsmarkens biomassa ovan jord ger en indikation om balansen mellan vinster på grund av skogens tillväxt och förluster på grund av avverkning eller av naturliga skäl, som skador på grund av brand, blåst, skadedjur och sjukdomar. Om indikatorn kan visa trender över en längre tidsperiod, kan ett stabilt eller ökande bestånd av biomassa indikera en hållbar skogsförvaltning. En minskning under längre tid kan innebära ohållbar skogsförvaltning eller oväntat stora förluster på grund av skador och sjukdomar.\n15.2.1.3 Andel skogsmark belägen inom formellt skyddade områden\nFörändringar i andelen formellt skyddad skogsmark ger en uppskattning av ett lands utveckling i bevarandet av skogens biologiska mångfald och dess kulturella och sociala värden. Det ger därmed en tydlig indikation om den politiska viljan att skydda och bevara skogsmark. Subindikator 3 har koppling till Aichimål 11, som innebär att varje land ska bevara minst 17 procent av sin land- och sötvattenareal.\n15.2.1.4 Andel skogsmark som omfattas av långsiktig skogsförvaltningsplan\nFörekomst av dokumenterad skogsförvaltningsplan utgör en grund för en långsiktig och hållbar förvaltning av skogens olika resurser. Statistik över förvaltningsplaner kan visa hur skogens sociala och ekonomiska värden kan samordnas med miljövärden.\n15.2.1.5 Skogsmark under oberoende verifierade certifieringssystem för skogsförvaltning\nDen femte och sista subindikatorn ger ytterligare information om skogsbruksförvaltningen, genom statistik över nationella eller internationella standarder för certifiering av skogsmark. Ett oberoende och verifierat certifieringssystem tillämpar i allmänhet högt ställda standarder och efterlevnaden verifieras i en oberoende och kvalitetssäkrad revision. En ökande areal certifierad skogsmark kan därmed ge mer information om utvecklingen mot hållbar skogsförvaltning. Det bör noteras att det finns betydande områden med hållbart förvaltade skogar som av olika skäl inte är certifierade.","summary":"Sub-indicators","data":[{"id":"15.2.1","disaggregations":[],"data":{"2006":{"year":2006,"value":66.6,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2007":{"year":2007,"value":66.8,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2008":{"year":2008,"value":67.3,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2009":{"year":2009,"value":68.1,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2010":{"year":2010,"value":68.8,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2011":{"year":2011,"value":69.2,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2012":{"year":2012,"value":70.1,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2013":{"year":2013,"value":70.8,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2014":{"year":2014,"value":70.9,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2015":{"year":2015,"value":71.5,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2016":{"year":2016,"value":71.8,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"},"2017":{"year":2017,"value":71.9,"disaggregations":[],"unit":"Percentage"}}}]},{"id":"15.2.2(N)","description":"Voluntary allotments, dedicated revival areas and unproductive forestland","type":"National","isReported":false,"sources":["SLU"],"definition":"Syftet med indikator 15.2.2 är att komplettera den statistik som presenteras för indikator 15.1.2 avseende hållbar skogsförvaltning.

Luftföroreningar tränger även in i närliggande byggnader vilket utgör ett problem främst i städer.\nEnligt Miljöhälsorapport 2017 orsakar luftföroreningar i Sverige att medellivslängden förkortas med cirka 6 månader och bidrar till cirka 1 000 sjukhusinläggningar per år i hjärt- och kärlsjukdom. Luftföroreningar bidrar även till olika lungsjukdomar och cancer. Alla luftföroreningar kommer inte från trafiken men enligt miljömålet Frisk luft utgör vägtrafik en stor källa till luftföroreningar, framförallt i tätorter.
